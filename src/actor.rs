/// Actors are objects which encapsulate state and behavior.
///
/// Actors run within specific execution context
/// [Context<A>](struct.Context.html).
/// Context object is available only during execution. Each actor has separate
/// execution context. Also execution context controls lifecycle of an actor.
///
/// Actors communicate exclusively by exchanging messages. Sender actor can
/// wait for response. Actors are not referenced directly, but by
/// non thread safe [`LocalAddress<A>`](struct.LocalAddress.html) or thread safe address
/// [`Address<A>`](struct.Address.html)
/// To be able to handle specific message actor has to provide
/// [`Handler<M>`](trait.Handler.html)
/// implementation for this message. All messages are statically typed. Message could be
/// handled in asynchronous fashion. Actor can spawn other actors or add futures or
/// streams to execution context. Actor trait provides several methods that allow
/// to control actor lifecycle.
///
/// # Actor lifecycle
///
/// ## Started
///
/// Actor starts in `Started` state, during this state `started` method get called.
///
/// ## Running
///
/// After Actor's method `started` get called, actor transitions to `Running` state.
/// Actor can stay in `running` state indefinitely long.
///
/// ## Stopping
///
/// Actor execution state changes to `stopping` state in following situations,
///
/// * `Context::stop` get called by actor itself
/// * all addresses to the actor get dropped
/// * no evented objects are registered in context.
///
/// Actor could restore from `stopping` state to `running` state by creating new
/// address or adding evented object, like future or stream, in `Actor::stopping` method.
///
/// If actor changed state to a `stopping` state because of `Context::stop()` get called
/// then context immediately stops processing incoming messages and calls
/// `Actor::stopping()` method. If actor does not restore back to a `running` state, all
/// unprocessed messages get dropped.
///
/// ## Stopped
///
/// If actor does not modify execution context during stooping state actor state changes
/// to `Stopped`. This state is considered final and at this point actor get dropped.
